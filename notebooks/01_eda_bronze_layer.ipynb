    "* **Green Taxi:** Uses the `lpep_` prefix (e.g., `lpep_pickup_datetime`).\n",

    "* **Yellow Taxi Only:** Contains `Airport_fee`.\n",
    "* **Engineering Impact:** We need to decide whether to drop these unique fields or include them as NULLs in the \"opposite\" fleet's model to maintain a consistent schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Spatial Granularity\n",
    "* Both fleets use `PULocationID` and `DOLocationID` (numeric IDs).\n",
    "* **Observation:** The sample shows IDs like `249`, `166`, `68`, and `174`. Without the `taxi_zone_lookup` seed, these rows are spatially anonymous.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Flag Variations\n",
    "* Both datasets include `store_and_fwd_flag` (e.g., 'N'), indicating whether the trip data was held in the vehicle's memory before transmission."

    "\n",
    "### 1. The Provider Problem (Vendor Analysis)\n",
    "* **Cross-Fleet Consistency:** Vendor 2 (VeriFone) is the dominant provider but carries the highest data gaps across both fleets, with an 18.3% NULL rate in Yellow and a 4.14% NULL rate in Green.\n",
    "* **Green Fleet Specialization:** Approximately 5.1% of Green Taxi trips are identified as 'Dispatch' (Type 2), while the remainder are street hails.\n",
    "* **Ghost Vendors:** Vendor 6 remains a high-risk data source with a 100% NULL rate for passenger counts across both datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Project Scope & Temporal Constraints\n",
    "To ensure analytical integrity and remove hardware-related \"drift,\" the following temporal constraints are established:\n",
    "* **In-Scope:** January 1, 2024, to December 31, 2025.\n",
    "* **Excluded Noise:** All legacy records from 2002, 2007, 2008, and 2009, as well as premature 2026 logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Outlier \"Sanity Bounds\" for Silver Layer\n",
    "Based on statistical profiling, the following filtering thresholds will be applied in the dbt staging models to remove sensor noise and data entry errors:\n",
    "* **Distance:** `trip_distance` must be $> 0$ and $< 100$ miles (to remove the 398k-mile outliers).\n",
    "* **Fares:** `total_amount` must be $> 0$ and $< $1,000 (to remove negative voids and $863k glitches).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Transformation Logic (Silver Layer Roadmap)\n",
    "* **Standardization:** Map disparate vendor IDs and consolidate pickup/dropoff timestamp columns into a unified schema.\n",
    "* **Imputation:** Use `COALESCE(passenger_count, 1)` to handle missing values, as 1 is the statistical mode for NYC taxi trips.\n",
    "* **Enrichment:** Join with the `taxi_zone_lookup` seed table to transition from numeric IDs to borough and zone names."
